One particularly effective approach is the use of biphasic media, which combine aqueous and non-aqueous phases. This biphasic system has been found to significantly enhance the efficiency of cellulose-based biofuel production. Our research will focus on investigating the properties of some of the interesting biphasic liquid media, with a specific emphasis on understanding their interfacial structure and its impact on chemical reactions relevant to cellulose-based biofuel production.
